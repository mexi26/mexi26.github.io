    <h1> Lets hear a quick story </h1>
    <p>So i did the reading related to flex box thinking that it was related to this assignment<br> 
        As i read about it I started to get worried. I figured that I would need to digest and practice all<br>
        the content on Flex box. I was worried becuase i started this reading on thursday and was worried<br>
        With my job and with my other CS classes that i wouldent be able to do a flexbox related assignment <br>
        effectively<br>
        Turns out, <strong> this assignment didnt need flexbox </strong>
        And i am so relieved. I still have time to learn more and do the practice problems in the slides<br>
        any way i Dj and my dj instagram is <strong>@dj.hectic</strong> on instagram and i work as KSSU's promtions director and <br>
        I manage their Social media pages and promotional event. I linked both instagrams but you need <br>
        to be signed in to instagram to view the pages.<br>
        but dont worry, i provided pictures as well.<br>
